# AOEII Minimap Magnifier

Should work with any AOE games if you properly adjust the resolutions. The program basically records a part of the screen, magnifies it and shows it to you.

## Installation and Running

- ***Clone*** the repository
- ***Install*** Python3
- ***Install*** required libraries: [*Opencv*](https://opencv.org/), [*Numpy*](https://numpy.org/), [*PyAutoGUI*](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- ***Run*** the main.py


## Modifying
- Change variables (xStart, xSize, yStart, ySize) if you are not using 1080p monitor (Or not playing AOEII HD).
- Change dim variable multipliers according to your needs. Or just give it a fixed value.
- Change the waitTime variable (in miliseconds, 1000ms = 1s) if you want higher/lower refresh rates. (Higher refresh rate = more resources needed.)
